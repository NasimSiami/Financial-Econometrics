# Long-Term Return Forecasting and Risk Modeling

This project implements long-term equity return forecasting using time series techniques, grounded in the Campbell-Shiller decomposition. Developed as part of MATH 60210 (Winter 2022) at HEC MontrÃ©al, it uses real-world S&P Composite Index data.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Scope

- Transform financial time series to compute `p-d`, `Î”d`, and `r`
- Implement return decomposition as described in Campbell-Shiller framework
- Build lag-based time series models for forecasting and risk evaluation
- Use custom functions, assertions, and statistical diagnostics to validate forecasts

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- SciPy, Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸ“ˆ Methods

- Campbell-Shiller decomposition
- Log-return and dividend transformation
- Lag matrix construction
- Forecast validation and visualization
